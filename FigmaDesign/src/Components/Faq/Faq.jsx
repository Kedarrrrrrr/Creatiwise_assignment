        <p className="faq-answer">
          My design process typically involves four key phases: research, design, prototype, and test.
          In the research phase, I gather insights about the user and their needs. In the design phase,
          I create wireframes and visual designs that meet those needs. In the prototype phase, I create 
          interactive models of the design for testing. In the test phase, I collect feedback from users 
          to refine the design.
